## 48% approval, 37% disapproval 

A national poll of adults found that Joe Biden (D) has 47.6% approval and 36.9% disapproval rate, for a +10.7 net approval rating. 15.5% of adults did not have an opinion. The poll sampled 1962 Americans and was adjusted to match a US nationally representative likely voter electorate by weighing on race, age, gender, education, income, socioeconomic status, region, 2016 Presidential vote, 2020 Presidential vote, and religious attitudes. The raw margin of error is +/-3 points with 95% confidence.

The poll was conducted as an online survey via Prolific, on Saturday, 6 March 2021. Notably this was before the distribution of checks from the 2021 COVID relief bill.
